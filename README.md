I enjoyed this manhwa. So, rather than a treasure island game, I decided to make a little game out of it.
# Instructions

Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program. 


The fun part was writing this story 😊

That said if you'd like to continue with my example, feel free to use the text snippets below...

### Game Snippet

```
Welcome to Solo Leveling! Your mission is to level up.

You are in a level F dungeon. Instruction: Defeat the dungeon's boss to go to level E. Dungeon's boss: Hobgoblin (Level  F-10).

WARNING! 
  The hobglobin may have globins as his tribesmen. 
  These guys smell nasty and are persistent in their greed.

Choose your weapon. Type "sword" or "spear".  
  SWORD
Good choice of weapon for close-range combat! You slay most of them and scale up by XP to F-8. Reach F-10 to take on the hobglobin.
```
